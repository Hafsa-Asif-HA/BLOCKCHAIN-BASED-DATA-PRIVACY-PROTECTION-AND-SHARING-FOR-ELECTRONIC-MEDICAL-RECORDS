# MedBlock
Our project is based on blockchain technology to address issues with traditional health record management systems. These systems are costly and often managed by third parties, which introduces the risk of data breaching or tampering. Additionally, they lack interoperability, forcing patients to repeatedly enter their basic information each time they visit a new healthcare facility. Our solution aims to bridge the gap between healthcare data and technology. We secure patients' medical records on the blockchain to prevent any data tampering. Furthermore, we empower patients by giving them ownership of their medical data, allowing them to decide with whom they want to share their sensitive information.
